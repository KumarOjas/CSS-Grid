# CSS Grid Presentation for Women in Tech Allies

This contains the code samples for the different sections of the CSS Grid Presentation for Women In Tech Allies on April 25, 2018.

This contains a little self-contained server so you can play around with the code, save, and it will auto refresh in your browser.

Requires Node and NPM installed on your machine which you can download here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have that installed, pull down this repo and in a terminal window, change to the directory where you pulled it down and run the following:

```
npm install

npm start

```

and this should pop open a browser where you can see the different folders and navigate to the code files in each folder.
